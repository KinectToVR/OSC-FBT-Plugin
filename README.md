# Amethyst OSC Plugin

This is a plugin which adds OSC support to Amethyst via the Amethyst plugin interface.

This plugin uses the [hekky-osc](https://github.com/hyblocker/hekky-osc) library. This library is currently not public, as it's still under development, and as such, you will not be able to compile this plugin independently for the time being.
